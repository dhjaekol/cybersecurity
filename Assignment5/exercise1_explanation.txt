Explanation of vulnerability in Problem 1

The parameter 'char *str' in void function allow any number of characters. Anything
above size of 8 will overflow buf[i] will overflow the subsequent variables on the
stack. Using an exploit of 10 hexadecimal values '0x654d614c' will overflow 
the check 'if (canary != CANARY)' and also (auth != 0) allowing 'Superuser'
to be printed.
